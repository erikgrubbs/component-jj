I'm choosing MongoDB for my DBMS. 

After benchmarking query speeds I found the performance to be fairly even,
with Postgres having about a 1ms advantage when querying by id and getting specific info.
However to get all information possible about a product it would be about 3x slower using 
Postgres due to the complexity of the queries.

Due to the nature of the application, i.e. we always need all the information about a product
to render our page correctly, having our data split into seperate tables provides
no practical benefit to the use of our application. For example I never need to know 
the information about a color on its own, I always need it in the context of a product.

In addition, since this dataset is full of 4 different many to many relationships,
having to populate the join tables made the file size of the Postgres database
4.8 gb, while the MongoDB database was 2.9 gb.

Finally the last reason to choose MongoDB over Postgres is that since the information
being stored does not need to be instantly verified via transactions, and does not contain
private/sensitive data, it doesn't have to be completely acid compliant.



UPDATE

I've begun querying by name and the speeds so far are drastically different.
Looking into ways of optimizing by mongoDb queries.

I've now added a text index to the field instead of just a normal one and that has drastically reduced 
the querty time so that now the mongo searches are actually faster than the postgres. 

Will still be using mongoDB.
